## Project Identity Check

This is **alpacapps-infra**. If the user mentions **finleg**, **portsie**, or **sponic** and the request doesn't match this project, **STOP** and warn:
> "You mentioned **{keyword}** but this session is in **alpacapps-infra**. Did you mean to run this in the other project?"

## Mandatory Behaviors

1. After code changes: push, wait ~90s for CI, then `git pull --rebase origin main` and read the freshly-bumped `version.json`. End your response with THAT version string verbatim + affected URLs. NEVER invent a version string or sequence number — the canonical string is always what CI just wrote to `version.json` (format `vYYMMDD.NN H:MMa`)
2. Push immediately — Cloudflare Pages deploys on push to main. See `docs/DEPLOY.md`
3. CI bumps version — never bump locally
4. Run SQL migrations directly — never ask the user to run SQL manually

## Code Guards

- Filter archived items: `.filter(s => !s.is_archived)` client-side
- No personal info in consumer/public views
- `showToast()` not `alert()` in admin
- `openLightbox(url)` for images
- Tailwind: use design tokens from `@theme` block (see `docs/PATTERNS.md`). Run `npm run css:build` after new classes.
